Sprint-1: 
1. Backend: Get accustomed with Google Earth Engine and Machine Learning algorithms (mostly linear and multi-variate regression).
2. Frontend: Get an idea about making dynamic websites and inserting direct backend output into the website post-processing through the model.

Sprint-2:
1. Start work on getting images and building a dataset with details about the images pertaining to the project (feature collection essentially).
2. Build a base website and plan out the requirements for the website. 

Sprint-3:
1. Start work on the Machine Learning model (includes understanding and learning about using Pytorch tensors).
2. Build a navigation bar for the website and include some new features to accomodate the backend outputs.

Sprint-4:
1. Focus on integration and bug removals for both backend and frontend alongside manage completion of the project.

Sprint-5:
Finish integration and work on the presentation.
